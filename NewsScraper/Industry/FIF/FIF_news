121,Financial Information Forum,FIF Year-End Event Summary - Non-Discretionary Regulatory Initiatives of 2019: How Should My Firm Prepare? ,"January 4, 2019Son-Mi Lee, Senior Regulatory Advisor, FIF; Christopher Bok, Director, FIFOn December 19, 2018, over 150 FIF industry participants representing broker-dealers, vendors, and exchanges joined the annual FIF year-end event held at Bloomberg’s flagship office located at 731 Lexington Avenue, New York City.  Opening remarks were made by Mike Tirello, Global Head of SSEOMS Product Compliance, Bloomberg.  Christopher Bok, Director of FIF, reviewed FIF’s 2018 activities, providing an update on FIF’s regulatory-focused working groups, including the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”), the Transaction Fee Pilot, SEC Rule 606 and several other initiatives covered in over 300 meetings held this year.Tom Jordan, FIF Advisory Chair, led the panel discussion focused on “Non-Discretionary Regulatory Initiatives of 2019.”  At first glance, the title leads one to ask -- what exactly does “Non-Discretionary” mean?  By “Non-Discretionary,” FIF is referring to regulatory initiatives and other industry projects which must be implemented in 2019.Panelists Ron Veith, Executive Director, JP Morgan and Mike Tirello, Bloomberg explained that 2019 poses numerous challenges to firms due to several rule implementations that are scheduled to go into effect, including Phase 2a of the CAT, SEC Rule 606, Regulation ATS-N, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as potential downstream effects of Brexit, which will require some firms’ compliance, legal, and technology teams to manage these regulatory initiatives in parallel to meet aggressive compliance dates.  John Ramsay, Chief Market Policy Officer, IEX, also noted that earlier in the day, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Transaction Fee Pilot for NMS Securities which should require that exchanges, at a minimum, comply with certain pre-pilot data collection and reporting obligations in 2019.Susan Crozier, Director of Product Management and Regulatory Affairs, FIS, noted that in addition to the broader rule implementations scheduled for 2019, firms should also be aware of and allocate resources to other mandates that will affect firms’ compliance and technology staffs in 2019, including those with compliance deadlines in early 2020 which will likely require development work in 2019.  These include FINRA’s scheduled termination of the Computer-to-Computer Interface (“CTCI”) Protocol, the Single Security Initiative (“SSI”) that will create new mortgage-backed securities to be issued and guaranteed by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, DTCC’s proposed ACATS Shortened Settlement Cycle, and the GSD Start Leg Repo Initiative.  Firms should also be monitoring the final proposal on the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest expected to be finalized in 2019.  In the fall of 2019, the Department of Labor is also expected to issue a revised final proposal on the Fiduciary Rule which was previously vacated by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals earlier in 2018.  These mandates, explained Crozier, will require substantial coding changes and/or system builds that will further stretch limited resources at many firms.Jim Dolan, Chief Compliance Officer of Luminex and Chair of FIF’s Cybersecurity Working Group explained that while the implementation of regulatory mandates should be a primary focus of the industries’ legal, compliance, and technology staffs, firms must remain vigilant with protecting themselves and their clients from the continued threat of cyber-attacks.  Dolan noted that firms should not only invest resources in security designed to protect their technology infrastructure, but also prioritize employee training, education, and the promotion of security best practices to defend themselves from bad actors.While the panel discussion made clear that the industry will be challenged with managing the implementation of several complex rule requirements scheduled for 2019, panelists emphasized that firms are not alone.  To that end, FIF panelists remarked on the invaluable resource FIF has proven to be for member firms in helping to alleviate the pressure and stress caused by such an environment. Through the facilitation of collaborative discussions among subject matter experts representing broker-dealers, service bureaus, execution venues, and vendors, FIF has and will continue to assist its member firms in easing the challenges of multi-layered rule implementations through the sharing of best practice recommendations and guidance.Further, panelists noted that FIF can also assist firms by providing advice on organizing operations and technology teams to adhere to such strict regulatory timelines and to leverage industry expertise available through FIF and members’ collective expertise to help support and more efficiently implement regulatory mandates.  In 2019, FIF expects the collective sharing and leveraging of industry best practices and expertise to be of even greater importance as the breadth and depth of various implementation mandates will require firms to efficiently manage resources well in advance of compliance deadlines.  Panelists also emphasized that in such a demanding environment, compliance, legal, and technology staff take all available time off to better maintain focus and avoid burnout since, as Jim Dolan humorously noted “a stressed compliance officer is an ineffective compliance officer.”In addition to FIF’s role in facilitating the sharing of best practices between FIF member firms, panelists noted that FIF performs a critical role with respect to advocating for its member firms through direct dialogue with the regulators (i.e. through formal and informal dialogue and the submission of comment letters).  Historically, Working Group discussions have had direct influence on the resolution of important regulatory uncertainties and revised rule expectations (i.e. the phased-in implementation of CAT) that have further eased compliance obligations.The event ended with closing remarks from FIF Chairman Leo McBlain, who spoke of the combined effect of two watershed developments – new regulations and advancing technology – that have impacted and will continue to impact the markets.  Namely, the National Market System Act, first established in the 1970s, under which the CAT and Rule 606 fall, set the tone of today’s regulatory environment.  Likewise, the invention of the stock ticker redirected real-time market data from exchange floors and into microprocessors and servers utilized to facilitate today’s fast-paced electronic markets.  McBlain noted that as trading technology and the underlying market structure continue to evolve, developments in these areas will continue to emerge.After the panel discussion concluded, participants enjoyed an opportunity to celebrate and network with industry colleagues with libations and hors d’oeuvres catered by Bloomberg staff.",fif.com/index.php/news-events/fif-news/fif-year-end-event-summary-non-discretionary-regulatory-initiatives-of-2019-how-should-my-firm-prepare,1546578000.0

227,Financial Information Forum,FIF Firm-designated ID sub-group,"FIF CAT WG Members,As we discussed on the FIF CAT WG call on May 5, group consensus is that there is much to be reviewed, learned, compared, and further defined regarding firm designated id as related to implementing CAT. As there may not be a uniform understanding of the firm designated id construct, the industry would be looking for a comprehensive understanding of it in order to correctly and consistently include as part of CAT reporting.To address this, FIF is starting a small sub-group to work through the various and seemingly complex scenarios re: firm-designated id.  SIFMA and potentially STA have agreed to join us in this effort. The results of the sub-group will be shared with FIF CAT WG, SIFMA, and STA; and  if there is interest, with the Advisory Committee, Operating Committee and Plan Processor.We are calling for participation from volunteer firms that will represent the broad spectrum of customer/account models across the industry – e.g., institutional, retail, intermediary (RIA’s, wealth management and managed accounts), service bureau, and clearing/custody firms. For planning purposes, you should assume the sub-group will meet once per week for several weeks.  The first meeting will take place during the week of May 22. Access to New Accounts experts within your firm would be very useful for this exercise.The proposed approach for the working group will be to define and select use cases from your firms that may be representative of the industry. Each firm, using a few of their use cases, will then define customer/firm-designated id profiles and associated CAT reports for orders, executions, and allocations for those customers, using the Firm Designated ID Walk-thru document as a model. The sub-group will review each firm’s work, and discuss any issues/questions/conclusions.The output of this sub-group will be a set of recommended use cases for incorporation into CAT specifications, documentation of additional firm-designated id scenarios that can be added to the Firm Designated ID Walk-thru document, identification of any potential CAT problems encountered in this exercise, and recommendations to better explain the firm-designated id and associated definition process.Volunteers should submit their name/firm tofifinfo@fif.comby Wednesday, May 17.",fif.com/index.php/login?return=aW5kZXgucGhwP29wdGlvbj1jb21fY29udGVudCZ2aWV3PWFydGljbGUmaWQ9MjAxMjc6ZmlmLWZpcm0tZGVzaWduYXRlZC1pZC1zdWItZ3JvdXAmY2F0aWQ9ODA=,1494820800.0

232,Financial Information Forum,CAT and President Trump Executive Order 13771,"Written by Thomas Jordan, President, Jordan & JordanOn March 23rd, while Jay Clayton (Nominee for Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission) was testifying before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 188 industry participants were attending a meeting of the Financial Information Forum (www.FIF.com) on the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT).How are these two events related? The Wall Street firms that are most familiar with the CAT (a consolidated database of all details involved in every stock transaction in the U.S.), such as the requirements for reporting to CAT and the tight timeframe for implementation, are working hard to be ready. Those that aren’t preparing, or are banking on its repeal, may be in for a rude awakening.  Generally, Wall Street doesn’t expect CAT to go away, and here’s why.We know that Mr. Clayton’s potential boss, President Trump, signed Executive Order 13771 (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs) on January 30, 2017, to offset the number and cost of new regulations. The Order requires agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one enacted.While the SEC Rule 613 that originally proposed CAT was formally adopted in July 2012, the plan for CAT implementation was more recently approved under the National Market System (NMS) in November 2016. The question is, if Rule 613 or the CAT NMS Plan were proposed today, would it meet the requirements of President Trump’s Executive Order?Potential Chair Clayton made clear in his testimony that the U.S. Capital Markets are the envy of the world and that well-functioning capital markets are important to every American. There is zero room for bad actors.The CAT is intended to support this goal, as noted by the SEC in approving the Plan: “The Commission believes that the Plan is reasonably designed to improve the completeness, accuracy, accessibility and timeliness of order and execution data used by regulators. The Commission believes that the Plan will facilitate regulators’ access to more complete, accurate and timely audit trail data. The Plan will also allow for more efficient and effective surveillance and analysis, which will better enable regulators to detect misconduct, reconstruct market events, and assess potential regulatory changes. As a result, the CAT NMS Plan should significantly improve regulatory efforts by the SROs and the Commission, including market surveillance, market reconstructions, enforcement investigations, and examinations of market participants. The Commission believes that improved regulatory efforts, in turn, will strengthen the integrity and efficiency of the markets, which will enhance investor protection and increase capital formation.”Does CAT meet the “Two-For-One Trump Test”?The data that must be reported to CAT goes far beyond that which is currently OATS-reportable (FINRA’s Order Audit Trail System), as it will include options transactions, allocations reports and detailed customer information; and, CAT requires reporting by industry members that were previously exempt. Given how extensive, invasive and expensive these reporting requirements are, does the CAT NMS Plan and the underlying requirements set forth by Rule 613 meet the “Trump Test” calling for the elimination of two regulations for every one introduced?  Well the good news is, if it is done right, CAT can eliminate OATS, COATS (FINRA’s Consolidated Options Audit Trail System), PHLX Rule 1022, as well as other exchange rules and key portions of Electronic Blue Sheets (EBS) and Large Trader Reporting (LTR).  Over the long term, as CAT continues to accumulate data and incorporate other asset classes such as debt securities and additional transaction types, it can eliminate all of EBS, LTR and many other current regulatory reporting requirements.Getting It RightThis requires thoughtful interpretation of rules, carefully designed specifications and realistic schedules. Along with a concerted effort by the industry and the regulators to work together, here are some key considerations:A defined reasonable timeframe for the retirement of regulatory reporting rules/systems which are duplicative of CAT reporting, especially focusing on OATS, EBS and LTR. The industry is working aggressively to ensure all prior needs are included or added to the CAT requirements or excluded where it is agreed there is no discernible benefit. The biggest fear is that some legacy system must survive because one or two minor data points were overlooked in building CAT. Duplicative reporting to legacy regulatory systems and to CAT must be as brief as possible to lessen the cost and burden to the industry.All the Participants must deliver proposals to the SEC by May 15 describing their approach/criteria to eliminate or modify their duplicative reporting systems.  While reporting Industry Members (broker dealers) are clearly focused on retirement of OATS, we wonder if FINRA’s plan will include the fields more recently added to meet Rule 4554 requirements for ATS Reporting.EBS cannot be retired in the near term because the scope of EBS is wider than the coverage CAT will provide in its early phases. EBS requires a historical data set that CAT must build over time, as well as certain asset classes such as fixed income that will not be included in CAT initially. While there are over a dozen fields of data required by EBS that were not mentioned in the CAT plan such as branch/registered representative number, solicited codes, broker-dealer codes, employer name, contra party, etc., working together as an industry will ensure that all fields deemed necessary going forward for regulatory purposes are included in the initial specifications.  That said, use of CAT by the regulators to query more recent equities and options transactions will offload some of the burden on industry members in responding to multiple EBS inquiries from the regulators and can initiate the start of a 6-year historical retention requirement.LTR elimination will require discussions with SEC staff to determine what additional fields, if any, must be included in CAT to support the Commission’s objectives in identifying and monitoring large trader activities.The specific requirements for allocation reporting have not yet been defined; we await reasonable regulatory decisions on capturing timestamps in the workflow so they are consistently reported and provide any real value or insight into market activity.Will the Reporting Burden be Decreased or Increased?That depends on who you ask, and when you ask.Under the requirements of Rule 613 and the Plan, all broker dealers with total capital of more than $500K must submit data to CAT’s central repository by November 2018. Many firms that are currently exempt from reporting under existing regulations such as OATS, will be required to report in this timeframe.  And, by November 2019, even the smallest broker-dealers will be required to report to CAT.There are approximately 4022 broker dealers with 1800 anticipated to have CAT reporting responsibilities (per the CAT NMS plan Cost Analysis). Approximately 1000 firms report to OATS today, which means that there are roughly 800 broker dealers, options market makers, ELPs, and Floor brokers who are exempt today from OATS that must report under CAT.Recommendations have been made by industry members to alter the implementation phases so all firms that are currently OATS reporters will be included in the first round of member reporting, and all non-OATS reporters will be included in the second round, regardless of firm size. Other industry recommendations would allow firms that meet high quality standards for reporting data to CAT, be relieved of their duplicative reporting obligations, even prior to formal retirement or elimination of regulators’ legacy reporting systems.  We are hopeful that the CAT requirements may continue to evolve such that these and other practical recommendations may be incorporated to hasten retirement and/or reduce the burden of regulatory reporting on industry members.Many of the larger firms that currently have multiple reporting obligations believe that, over the longer term, CAT will provide benefit to both the industry and the regulators. Ultimately, CAT will enable elimination of a variety of regulatory reporting systems as they are replaced with the comprehensive CAT system; however, until such time, the costs and burdens to implement CAT will be significantly increased, and magnified if duplicative reporting is necessary for an extended period of time. Therefore, the most important priority of the larger industry members is the expeditious elimination of duplicative reporting obligations and rapid transition to CAT as the “consolidated” single regulatory reporting source, which firms hope will streamline the process and provide cost savings over the longer term.The smaller industry members who are currently exempt from many forms of reporting are faced with a different reality, and will likely seek assistance from their service providers.Opportunities for Expanded ServicesBest positioned to offer CAT-reporting services could be Order Routing Vendors (expand from OATS), Clearing Firms (expand from EBS) and Service Bureaus. We expect that new industry utilities will be created to support CAT reporting. By leveraging existing processes, such as FIX platforms to receive all orders, cancels, executions etc., the cost can be minimized when delivered on a consolidated basis. New services can also consume CAT data to support other regulatory functions such as reporting pursuant to SEC Rules 605/606, firm surveillance and TCA.Breaking New GroundCAT requirements for reporting of detailed customer information will push the industry into territories that have not previously been explored.  While the use of a “firm-designated id” rather than a universal code for each trading account and beneficial owner does represent a reasonable compromise made by the SROs, FINRA, SEC and the industry, this aspect of CAT reporting remains a major concern from a data security and an implementation perspective.   Every firm has a daunting task to ensure that their customer databases are able to link the complex relationships and identifying information that must be reported to CAT – information such as persons with documented trading authority for each account, trustees and beneficial owners, interested parties, etc. All firms have historically been challenged to ensure accurate customer linkages across front, middle and back office systems where multiple identifiers are often utilized for the same customer.   This can require significant analysis and reconciliation.I suggest that all firms focus on their customer account information immediately, to ensure they are fully prepared to upload all active accounts to CAT when required (currently scheduled for October 2018 for large industry members).Moving ForwardI am encouraged for the potential outcome. FIF, SIFMA and STA are working with the regulators on a pro-active basis. There is a very competent CAT Advisory Committee in place, providing input to the SROs. The new SEC Commissioner nominee understands the importance of thorough but cost efficient regulation.This may not “Make Regulation Great Again” but it is a positive step for the industry and investors, if we implement CAT correctly.",fif.com/index.php/login?return=aW5kZXgucGhwP29wdGlvbj1jb21fY29udGVudCZ2aWV3PWFydGljbGUmaWQ9MjAwNTU6Y2F0LWFuZC1wcmVzaWRlbnQtdHJ1bXAtZXhlY3V0aXZlLW9yZGVyLTEzNzcxJmNhdGlkPTgw,1491192000.0
